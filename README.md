# Emotion-Detection-

The aim of this project is to classify people's emotions based on their face images and then serve the model using Tensorflow 2.0 for real time prediction.
I try to accomplish this by combining a facial landmark prediction model along with the emotion classification model. The dataset consists of 24568 grayscale images with five emotions - angry, disgusted, happy, sad and surprised.

All steps are explained in the Ipython notebook.
